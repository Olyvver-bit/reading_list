# Monthly Reading List

**Objective:** The goal of this project is to recommend 5 books each month from the Complete 500 List, curated by the OCLC WorldCat databaseâ€”the world's largest library catalog managed by OCLC, a nonprofit cooperative that connects thousands of member libraries worldwide. These recommendations will form a monthly reading list designed to help users explore timeless literary masterpieces and gain insight into the most celebrated works of literature.

**Description:** By selecting 5 books from the top 500, users can instantly dive into the best works without the need for extensive research. This program simplifies the reading experience by offering reliable, high-quality recommendations, allowing users to focus on cultivating a consistent habit of reading. With curated monthly selections, users can broaden their knowledge and immerse themselves in world-class literature efficiently.

**Value Proposition:** The project stands out for its user-friendly approach and the reliability of its recommendations, drawn from the well-regarded OCLC book list. By providing a structured path to read 5 books per month, it promotes a steady and enriching reading routine, helping users become more well-read with minimal effort.
